# Elite Lore

There is a wealth of information on the story of Elite contained in books, forum posts and blogs.  This is a humble attempt to collate this information so that I can make sense of the big picture and write stories that are true to its lore.

## Methodology

There is so much auxiliary information surrounding the Elite: Dangerous universe that it can be quite difficult to determine what is canon and what is not.  I wish this to be first and foremost a repository of sourced information, whether through officially licensed books, tweets or forum posts from Frontier staff or licensed writers, or in-game \(non user submitted\) GALnet articles, or other viable and credible sources.  Therefore my praxis is simple: _nothing goes in without a source_.

## Contributing

Alternatively you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/cmdrdahkron/elite-lore/issues) and bring it to my attention there.
