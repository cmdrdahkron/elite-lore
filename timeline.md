New Rossyth Shipyards secretly builds the Crimson Arrow.It is ﬁrst new Python class star cruiser in over two hundred years and is outﬁtted with the new Class 4 Military Drive.The addition of this new drive, plus the use of some new, lighter, and more durable hull materials gives the new ship the designation Python MkII. The ship blasts its way out of its hidden orbital hangar to avoid destruction by a surprise attack by the INRA and then engages its experimental hyperdrive and disappears.

AJN's training academy, the Turner Space Combat Academy, is opened at Dublin Citadel \(Gateway\).

## 3262

Veliaze joins the AIS, much to Hengist Duval's annoyance.

Deep space probes return with news that the star, Betelgeuse, went supernova. The Alliance Science Council dispatches hundreds of deep space probes to study the nova. Meanwhile, a second LRA-object is discovered. Considerably more caution is taken examining this object. It still yields few secrets, and eventually disappears with a number of deep space probes attached to it.

James Winston is captured by Federation forces and held in prison on Boston Base, Barnard's Star. This creates a massive protest by Alliance citizens and the military. Winston's nephew ﬁnds himself harassed by the Federals due to his presence on the station at the time of his uncle's capture.

Membership in The Cause increases exponentially as a result of Winston's alleged kidnapping by the Federation and imprisonment.

The Cause makes its oﬃcial base on Davies Earth in the Quator system and aquires the Long Range Cruiser Azure Sunset.
