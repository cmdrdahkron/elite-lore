# A Brief History Of Everything

A lot has happened since the 21st century. We've made incredible advancements in science, engineering and medicine. We've extended our lifetimes and travelled further away from our home planet than our ancestors could ever have dreamed possible. Though as far as we've come, the familiar traits of the human race are as present today as they were back then, and in a lot of ways it would be hard to argue we have really evolved at all. It was in this century that it all began, when overpopulation reached its tipping point and we finally started paying the true price of our neglect and forced upon ourselves an ultimatum: move out to the stars, or suffocate.[^1]
